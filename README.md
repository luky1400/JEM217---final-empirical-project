# JEM217: final-empirical-project
This repository serves as the supportive tool for conducting final empirical project on Advanced Econometrics course.

1.) It is hosting Python code used to dowload data from [sreality](https://www.sreality.cz/) using its public [API](https://www.sreality.cz/api/cs/v2/estates?). Raw data are downloaded in download.py using functions from functions_all and saved into estate_data.sqlite.

2.) Moreover, Python cleaning code can be found in cleaning.ipynb which cleans the raw data and save them into *data.csv* and output excel files (same data) which are prepared dataframes for more cleaning in Python and an econometrical analysis conducted in R (not in this repository - will be sent to mail).
