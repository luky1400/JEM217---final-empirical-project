# JEM217: final-empirical-project
This repository is hosting Python code used to dowload data from [sreality](https://www.sreality.cz/) using its public [API](https://www.sreality.cz/api/cs/v2/estates?) for conducting final empirical project.

Data are downloaded in download.py using functions from functions_all and saved into estate_data.sqlite. Afterwards, data are cleaned in cleaning.ipynb and saved into csv file and then processed using R language.
